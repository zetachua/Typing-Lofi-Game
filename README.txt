A simple typing game that can track your wpm (words per minute). 
Theme: Lofi Japanese Vibes, Chill

My requirements in this Unity project:
1. 3D interactable objects imported from blender using fbx files: Sakura Tree, Roots
2. UI interactions: different menu UIs using scenes and popups (pause menu, start menu, eng game menu, neon signboard)
3. Animations: Orbit around fixed point, Tree Swaying motion
4. Runtime update of materials/shaders: neon signboard
5. Physics Interaction: Sakura petal Particles
6. Win/Lose condition: timer based 60 seconds, to find WPM (words per minute) typed
7. Sound (BGM,SFX): chill lofi beats, and type writer sound effects
8. Lighting and use of shaders: Neon signboard 
9. Particle Systems: Sakura petals with post processing 


Assets:
